## Get started

Run `gulp init` everytime after you install `node_modules`

1. `npm i`
2. `gulp init`
3. `make dev`

Load up `localhost:2368` in your browser, navigate to `localhost:2368/ghost` to login and switch the default theme, then go back home.

You should only repeat these steps on new installs only. After you complete this once you should be good to go.
